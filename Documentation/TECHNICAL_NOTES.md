#Deployment

Web deployment methods http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff356104.aspx
Using Web Deploy Remote Service as more powerful.

Scripts generated by VS2010 SP1 have a bug in handling of quote chars, preventing passing command line options to AppMetrics.Deploy.cmd.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5539968/msdeploy-batch-file-does-not-handle-quotes-anymore
There is a workaround by patching Microsoft.Web.Publishing.targets file.
Alternative way is to set parameter in the AppMetrics.SetParameters.xml file, or by passing flags via _MsDeployAdditionalFlags environment variable, or using MSDeploy attributes in the csproj file (http://efreedom.com/Question/1-7100751/Set-MSDeploy-Settings-Csproj-File).

Override name of target web application:
command line key "-setParam:name='IIS Web Application Name',value='Default Web Site/SomeName'"

Skipping the folder containing logs:
command line key "skip:objectname='dirPath',absolutepath='App_Data'"

#Continuous integration: build, deployment and testing

Steps:
1. run script to build binaries and deployment package
2. Jenkins deploys it to the live server, in the temporary versioned location
3. run another script to run tests and check if everything is ok
4. reconfigure AppMetrics entry point in IIS to point to the latest installed version
